thunder . now the days are getting cooler and the burning of our limbs . doesnt happen quite as bad and the burn is just skin . deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter . like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasnt winter . and everywhere we go i can feel the subtle taste . of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed . and youre no better at swimming than you were in the

that happened to be free . how dare you think youd get away with tryin to play me . but despite the truth that i know . i find it hard to let go and give up on you . seems i love the things you do . like the meaner you treat me more eager i am . to persist with this heartbreak of runnin around . and i will do until i find myself with you . and make you feel a way youve never felt before . and be all you need so that you never want more . then youd say all of the right things without a clue . and youll be the one for me and me the one for you . produced by jim abbiss . who wants to be right as

dont wanna leave home without your love . without it . you told me you were coming back right back . you promised it was real and i believed that . but if i fall for it again i will be a fool . if our love is at the end then why do i still want you yeah . but i guess i got no valentine . send me roses ill just let em die . i was crazy thinking you were mine . it was all just a lie . drive my heart

was dreaming about the other dude . and then all of a sudden everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again . this whole time i could give to you and i could paint you pictures but i guess i could just never write a song and then maybe id never fell out of love with him in the first place . i mean i i dont wanna feel this feeling cause my energys just so strong that i dont know if im creating this or this is actually what is meant to be . and you know that they say that you gotta think what you want into existence but you know i havent been too good at making decisions so i have no idea what the fuck i want i guess . youre giving me a feeling in my head . laying in my bed just thinking . not really feeling like the one i want . takes everything in me not to call him . i really really really want it too . i told all my friends im moving on . your baby talk is creeping me out . fuck me so you stop baby talking

your mom . dude as if im not fucking awkward enough . i mean you put me in these fucking situations where i look like a dumbass bitch and im not a fucking dumbass bitch . you know like i hate all that

what . look i like when you send me you know the the queen emoji but when i send back the monkey you know the ones with the the hands over the eyes that means that shits just getting a little too weird for me . i mean i dont wanna say it in person i just bury my head in your armpit which weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth . like why the fuck would i wanna lick your teeth but i do . and remember there was that one time that i had like a 15 minute . well that was kind of the best thing in the entire world . you know maybe i could just get past this shit and i could get used to someone giving a fuck . im sorry i called you a creep and that thing about the vomit . i mean look im really starting to be in this whole thing but no matter what you do homegirl cant handle the fucking goo . fuck me so youll stop baby talking . fuck me so youll stop baby talking . fuck me so youll stop baby talking . fuck me so youll stop baby talking . i dont really wanna get over you .

many colors . every piece was small . and i didnt have a coat . and it was way down in the fall . mama sewed the rags together . sewing every piece with love . she made my coat of many colors . that i was so proud of . as she sewed she told a story . from the bible she had read . about a coat of many colors . joseph wore and then she said . perhaps this coat will bring you . good luck and happiness . and i just couldnt wait to wear it . and momma blessed it with a kiss . my coat of many colors . that my mama made for me . made only from rags . but i wore it so proudly . although we had no money . i was rich as i could be . in my coat of many colors . my mama made for me . so with patches on my britches . holes in both my shoes . in my coat of many colors . i hurried off to school . just to find the others laughing . and making fun of me . in my coat of many colors . my mama made for me . and oh i couldnt understand it . for i felt i was rich . and i told them of the love . my mama sewed in every stitch . and i told them all the story . mama told me while she sewed . and how my coat of many colors . was worth more than all their clothes . but they didnt understand it . and i tried to make them see . that one is only poor . only if they choose to be . now i know we had no money . but i was rich as i could be . in my coat of many colors . my mama made for me . made just for me . if i should stay . i would only be in your way . so ill go but i know . ill think of you each step of the way . and i will always love you . i will always love you . bittersweet memories . thats all im taking with me . goodbye please dont cry . we both know that im not what you need . but i will always love you . i will always love you . i hope life treats you kind . and i hope that you have all . that you ever dreamed of . and i wish you joy and happiness . but above all this i wish you love . and i will always love you . i will always love you . i will always love you . i could hold out my arms say i love you this much . i could tell you how long i will long for your touch . how much and how far would i go to prove . the depth and the breadth of my love for you . from here to the moon and back . who else in this world will love you like that . love everlasting i promise you that . from here to the moon and back . from here to the moon and back . i want you to know you can always depend . on promises made and love without end . no need to wonder how faithful ill be . now and on into eternity . from here to the moon and back . who else in this world will love you like that . forever and always ill be where youre at . from here to the moon and back . from here to the moon and back . i would blow you a kiss from the star where i sat . i would call out your name to echo through the vast . thank heaven for you and to god tip my hat . from here to the moon and back . and ill spend forever just proving that fact . from here to the moon and back . here you come again . just when id begun to get myself together . you waltz right in the door . just like youve done before . and wrap my heart round your little finger . here you come again . just when im about to make it work without you . you look into my eyes . and lie those pretty lies . and pretty soon im wondering how i came to doubt you . all you got to do is smile that smile . and there go all my defenses . just leave it up to you and in a little while . youre messing up my mind and filling up my senses . here you come again . looking better than a body has a right to . and shaking me up so that all i

sun sets . he gets fierce in my dreams seizing my guts . he floors me with dread . soaked to soul he swims in my eyes by the bed . pour myself over him . moon spilling in . and i wake up alone . if i was my heart . id rather be restless . second i stop the sleep catches up and im breathless . cause this ache in my chest . cause my day is done now . the dark covers me and i cannot run now . my blood running cold . i stand before him before him . its all i can do to assure him assure him . when he comes to me . i drip for him tonight . drowning in me we bathe under blue light . he is fierce in my dreams seizing my guts . he floods me with dread . soaked to his soul . he swims in my eyes by the bed . pour myself over him . moon spilling in . and i wake up alone . and i wake up alone . and i wake up alone . and i wake up alone . when you walk in the bar . and you’re dressed like a star . rocking your fmepumps . and a man notice you . with your gucci bag crew . can’t tell who he’s looking to . cause you all look the same . everyone knows your name . and that’s your whole claim to fame . never miss a night . cause your dream in life . is to be a footballer’s wife . you don’t like players . that’s what you saya . but you really wouldnt mind a millionaire . you don’t like ballers . they don’t do nothing for ya . but youd love a rich man six foot two or taller . you’re more than a fan . looking for a man . but you end up with one night stands . he could be your whole life . if you got past one night . but that part never goes right . in the morning you’re vexed . he’s on to the next . and you didnt even get no text . don’t be too upset . if they call you a sket . cause like the news every day you get pressed . you don’t like players . that’s what you saya . but you really wouldnt mind a millionaire . all them big ballers . don’t do nothing for ya . but youd love a rich man six foot two or taller . you can’t sit down right . because your jeans are too tight . and you lucky it’s ladies night . with your big empty purse . every week it gets worse . at least your breast cost more than hers . so you did miami . cause you got there for free . but somehow you missed the plane . you did too much e . met somebody . and spent the night getting caned . without girls like you there’d be no fun . we’d go to the club and not see anyone . without girls like you there’s no night life . all those men just go home to their wives . don’t be mad at me . cause your pushing 30 . and your old tricks no longer work . you should have known from the jump . that you always get dumped . so dust off your fuck me pumps . when will we get the time to be just friends . its never safe for us not even in the evening . cos ive been drinking . not in the morning where your shit works . its always dangerous when everybodys sleeping . and ive been thinking . can we be alone . can we be alone . when will we get the time to be just friends . when will we get the time to be just friends . and no im not ashamed but the guilt will kill you . if she dont first . ill never love you like her . though we need to find the time . to just do this shit together . for it gets worse . i wanna touch you . but that just hurts . when will we get the time to be just just friends . when will we get the time to be just friends just friends . when will we get the time to be just friends just friends . when will we get the time to be just friends just friends . just friends . lent you outsidaz and my new badu . while you were thinking i didnt have a clue . tough to sort files with your voice in my head . so then i bribed you downstairs with a marlboro red uh huh . and now i feel so small discovering you knew . how much more torture would you have put me through . you probably saw me laughing at all your jokes . or how i did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah . and although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah . you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb . with your battered jeans and your beasties tee . now i cant work like this with you next to me . and although hes nothing in the scheme of my years . it just serves to bludgeon my futile tears . and im not use to this no no i observe yeah i dont chase . but now im stuck with consequences thrust in my face yeah . and the melodramas of my day deliver blows . and that surpass your rejection it just goes to show . a simple attraction that reflects right back to me . so im not as into you as i appear to be . and although my pride is not easily disturbed yeah . you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb . with your battered jeans and your beasties tee . now i cant work like this with you next to me . his message was brutal but the delivery was kind . maybe if i get this down ill get it off my mind yeah . oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks . despite my frustration for the way that he thinks . and i knew the truth when it came would be to that effect . at least youre attracted to me which i did not expect . didnt think youd get my number down as such . but i never hated myself for my age so much yeah . and although my pride is not easily disturbed yeah . you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb . with your battered jeans and your beasties tee . now i cant work like this with you next to me . and although my pride is not easily disturbed yeah . you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb . with your battered jeans and your beasties tee . now i cant work like this with you next to me . he can only hold her for so long . the lights are on but no ones home . shes so vacant her soul is taken . he thinks whats she running from . now how can he have her heart . when it got stole . so he tries to pacify her . because whats inside her never dies . even if shes content in his warmth . she is plagued with urgency . searching kisses the man she misses . the man that he longs to be . now how can he have her heart . when it got stole . so he tries to pacify her . because whats inside her never dies . so he tries to pacify her . because whats inside her it never dies . so he tries to pacify her . but whats inside her never dies . i never wanted you to be my man . i just needed company . dont want to get dependent on . your time or who you spend it on . i lose it when you love me . like smoke i hung around in the unbalanced . woah ohh . it’s not a movie this is not a script to proofread . i’ll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies . fun to punctuate pronounciate the funds i make . the miles i take put in your face . oh my mistake you’re not a floozy . then excuse me . before i talk my style introduced me . get your name and phone number like 123 . y’all know the story y’all know the commentary . i kick the narrative this is legendary . the good samaritan hood thespian . like a polygamist with a twist . will i marry again maybe i guess . i hold a lady’s interest i just met . the love scholar she’s the teacher’s

all comes down to make the sound of our love song . the taste the touch the way we love . it all comes down to make the sound of our love song . presong . i was in the winter of my life . and the men i met along the road were my only summer . at night i fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them . three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me . and my only real happy times . i was a singer . not a very popular one . i once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet . but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky . that i wished on over and over again sparkling and broken . but i didn’t really mind because i knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is . when the people i used to know found out what i had been doing how i had been living they asked me why but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home . they have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people . for home to be wherever you lie your head . i was always an unusual girl . my mother told me that i had a chameleon soul . no moral compass pointing due north . no fixed personality . just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean . and if i said i didn’t plan for it to turn out this way i’d be lying . because i was born to be the other woman . who belonged to no one . who belonged to everyone . who had nothing . who wanted everything . with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that i couldn’t even talk about it . and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me . song . postsong . every night i used to pray that i’d find my people . and finally i did . on the open road . we had nothing to lose nothing to gain nothing we desired anymore . except to make our lives into a work of art . live fast . die young . be wild . and have fun . i believe in the country america used to be . i believe in the person i want to become . i believe in the freedom of the open road . and my motto is the same as ever . i believe in the kindness of strangers . and when im at war with myself . i ride . i just ride . who are you . are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies . have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them . i have . i am fucking crazy . but i am free . cinnamon in my teeth . from your kiss youre touching me . all the pills that you take . violet blue green red to keep me at arms length dont work . you try to push me out but i just find my way back in . violet blue green red to keep me out i win . theres things i wanna say to you but ill just let you live . like if you hold me without hurting me . youll be the first who ever did . theres things i wanna talk about but better not to give . but if you hold me without hurting me . youll be the first who ever did . ah ah ah ah ah ah . hold me love me touch me honey . be the first who ever did . ah ah ah ah ah ah . hold me love me touch me honey . be the

manifesto . im doin it for all of us . who never got the chance . for… and for… shut up shut up . and all my birds of paradise shut up shut up . who never got to fly at night shut up shut up . cause

or live my own life . and now i do . i wanna move . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . finally . gone is the burden . of the crowley way of being . that comes from energies combined . like my part was i . was not discernin . and you as we found out . were not in your right mind . theres no more chasing rainbows . and hoping for an end to them . their arches are illusions . solid at first glance . but then you try to touch them touch touch . theres nothing to hold on to hold hold . the colors used to lure you in shut up shut up . and put you in a trance ah ah ah yeah . sometimes it feels like ive got a war in my mind . i want to get off but i keep ridin the ride . i never really noticed that i had to decide . to play someones game or live my own life . and now i do . i wanna move . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . i dont belong in the world thats what it is . something separates me from other people . everywhere i turn theres something blocking my escape . it took thirteen beaches to find one empty . but finally its mine . with drippin peaches im camera ready . almost all the time . but i still get lonely . and baby only then do i let myself recline . can i let go and let your

i met along the road were my only summer . at night i fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them . three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me . and my only real happy times . i was a singer . not a very popular one . i once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet . but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky . that i wished on over and over again sparkling and broken . but i didn’t really mind because i knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is . when the people i used to know found out what i had been doing how i had been living they asked me why but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home . they have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people . for home to be wherever you lie your head . i was always an unusual girl . my mother told me that i had a chameleon soul . no moral compass pointing due north . no fixed personality . just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean . and if i said i didn’t plan for it to turn out this way i’d be lying . because i was born to be the other woman . who belonged to no one . who belonged to everyone . who had nothing . who wanted everything . with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that i couldn’t even talk about it . and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me . song . postsong . every night i used to pray that i’d find my people . and finally i did . on the open road . we had nothing to lose nothing to gain nothing we desired anymore . except to make our lives into a work of art . live fast . die young . be wild . and have fun . i believe in the country america used to be . i believe in the person i want to become . i believe in the freedom of the open road . and my motto is the same as ever . i believe in the kindness of strangers . and when im at war with myself . i ride . i just ride . who are you . are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies . have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them . i have . i am fucking crazy . but i am free . cinnamon in my teeth . from your kiss youre touching me . all the pills that you take . violet blue green red to keep me at arms length dont work . you try to push me out but i just find my way back in . violet blue green red to keep me out i win . theres things i wanna say to you but ill just let you live . like if you hold me without hurting me . youll be the first who ever did . theres things i wanna talk about but better not to give . but if you hold me without hurting me . youll be the first who ever did . ah ah ah ah ah ah . hold me love me touch me honey . be the first who ever did . ah ah ah ah ah ah . hold me love me touch me honey . be the

manifesto . im doin it for all of us . who never got the chance . for… and for… shut up shut up . and all my birds of paradise shut up shut up . who never got to fly at night shut up shut up . cause they were caught up in the dance . sometimes it feels like ive got a war in my mind . i want to get off but i keep ridin the ride . i never really noticed that i had to decide . to play someones game or live my own life . and now i do . i wanna move . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . finally . gone is the burden . of the crowley way of being . that comes from energies combined . like my part was i . was not discernin . and you as we found out . were not in your right mind . theres no more chasing rainbows . and hoping for an end to them . their arches are illusions . solid at first glance . but then you try to touch them touch touch . theres nothing to hold on to hold hold . the colors used to lure you in shut up shut up . and put you in a trance ah ah ah yeah . sometimes it feels like ive got a war in my mind . i want to get off but i keep ridin the ride . i never really noticed that i had to decide . to play someones game or live my own life . and now i do . i wanna move . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . out of the black out of the black . into the blue into the blue . i dont belong in the world thats what it is . something separates me from other people . everywhere i turn theres something blocking my escape . it took thirteen beaches to find one empty . but finally its mine . with drippin peaches im camera ready . almost all the time . but i still get lonely . and baby only then do i let myself recline . can i let go and let your memory dance . in the ballroom of my mind . across the county line . it hurts to love you but i still love you . its just the way i feel . and id be lyin if i kept hidin . the fact that i cant deal .
